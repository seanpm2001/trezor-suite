# @trezor/suite-desktop and @trezor/suite-web e2e tests

@trezor/suite uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to run e2e tests. It also uses [trezor-user-env](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-user-env) which is [daily built](https://gitlab.com/satoshilabs/trezor/trezor-user-env/-/pipelines) into a docker image providing all the necessary instrumentation required to run tests (bridge and emulators).

## Run it locally

_Note: All paths below are relative to the root of trezor-suite repository, if not specified otherwise._

### Common

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
-   [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (to share your screen with Docker)
-   [Trezor user env](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-user-env)
-   No other instance of `Suite` or `trezord` service is running

Steps:

1. Run XQuartz. Wait till it is launched. Leave it running in the background.
1. In XQuartz settings go to Preferences -> Security and enable "Allow connections from network clients".
1. Open a new terminal window (not in XQuartz) and add yourself to the X access control list:
    - `xhost +127.0.0.1`
    - You will probably need to logout/login after XQuartz installation to have `xhost` command available.
1. Run Docker and go to Preferences -> Resources -> Advanced and increase RAM to at least 4GB. Otherwise, the app during tests does not even load.
1. In the terminal window, set two environment variables:
    - ``export HOSTNAME=`hostname` ``
    - `export DISPLAY=${HOSTNAME}:0`
1. In terminal window, navigate to `trezor-user-env` repo root and run `./run.sh`.

### Web

1. In another window, run web `Suite` with `yarn suite:dev`.
1. In a third window, run `yarn workspace @trezor/suite-desktop-core test:e2e:web`.

### Desktop

1. `yarn workspace @trezor/suite-desktop build:ui`

    Produces `suite-desktop/build` directory with javascript bundles in production mode.

    _Note: This step needs to be repeated on each change in suite-desktop-ui package._

1. `yarn workspace @trezor/suite-desktop build:app`

    Produces `suite-desktop/dist` directory with javascript bundles in production mode and application assets.

    _Note: This step needs to be repeated on each change in suite-desktop-core package._

1. `yarn workspace @trezor/suite-desktop-core test:e2e:desktop`

#### Troubleshooting

1. **To run just one test** you can do: `yarn workspace @trezor/suite-desktop-core test:e2e:web general/wallet-discovery.test.ts`

1. **To run one group** you can do: `yarn workspace @trezor/suite-desktop-core test:e2e:web --grep=@group=wallet`

1. **To debug test** add `await window.pause();` to place where you want test to stop. Debugger window will open.

1. **To enable Debug Tools in the browser** press `Ctrl+Shift+I`

## Contribution

Please follow our general [Playwright contribution guide](e2e-playwright-contribution-guide.md)

### Tags

Each test should be assigned a tag

At the moment, there are the following tags:

-   @group=[string]
-   @desktopOnly

#### @group

Assigning a @group allows test runner to run the groups in parallel on CI. At the moment these groups exist:

-   `@group=wallet`
-   `@group=settings`

#### @desktopOnly

Some tests are only applicable for Desktop app and you can use this tag to notify the runner, that the test should be ignored when running against web Suite.
